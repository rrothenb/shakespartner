all the whole time i was my chambers prisoner
all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
all these are servants to deceitful men
all things are ready if our minds be so

and so will i richard
and some have greatness thrust upon them
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands
and speaking it he wistly lookd on me and who should say i would thou wert the man that would divorce this terror from my heart meaning the king at pomfret come lets go i am the kings friend and will rid his foe
and speakt again my lord no more with me
and sped you sir
and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore

and strange it is that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds
and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leavetaking justles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robbers haste crams his rich thievery up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consignd kisses to them he fumbles up into a lose adieu and scants us with a single famishd kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears
and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else
and take my heart with thee
and target still he mends but this is not the best look prithee charmian how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe
and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true even in the soul of sound goodfellowship who in your thoughts merits fair helen best myself or menelaus
and tells us what occasion of import hath all so long detaind you from your wife and sent you hither so unlike yourself
and thane of cawdor too went it not so
and thank you too for society saith the text is the happiness of life
and that count claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace hero before the whole assembly and not marry her
and that he will and shall if lucius live
and that his bags shall prove
and that i love the tree from whence thou sprangst witness the loving kiss i give the fruit and cried all hail when as he meant all harm
and that is claudio i know him by his bearing
and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be your concubine
and that is my petition noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent yet know my lord i was provoked by him and he first took exceptions at this badge pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewrayd the faintness of my masters heart
and that letter hath she delivered and there an end
and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend
and that my lord of norfolk
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the holy sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
and that set together is noddy
and that she should love this fellow and refuse me
and that well might advise him to a caution to hold what distance his wisdom can provide some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed
and that would she for twenty thousand more
and that you would have me to do
and thats a good root
and thats but unwholesome food they say
and thats great marvel loving a light wench don
and thats the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
and thats true too
and the business you have broached here cannot be without you especially that of cleopatras which wholly depends on your abode
and the creature run from the cur there thou mightst behold the great image of authority a dogs obeyed in office thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand why dost thou lash that whore strip thine own back thou hotly lustst to use her in that kind for which thou whippst her the usurer hangs the cozener through tatterd clothes small vices do appear robes and furrd gowns hide all plate sin with gold and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks arm it in rags a pigmys straw does pierce it none does offend none i say none ill able em take that of me my friend who have the power to seal the accusers lips get thee glass eyes and like a scurvy politician seem to see the things thou dost not now now now now pull off my boots harder harder so
and the like tender of our love we make to rest without a spot for evermore
and the queen too and that presently
and the rarest that eer came there
and then
and then came pyramus
and then he sends you word he dreamt tonight the boar had razed his helm besides he says there are two councils held and that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at the other therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure if presently you will take horse with him and with all speed post with him toward the north to shun the danger that his soul divines
and then his banishment
and then i comes behind
and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation
and then sir does he thishe doeswhat was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave
and then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them i know my place as i would they should do theirs to for my kinsman toby
and there will we be too ere it be long or else reproach be talbots greatest fame vow burgundy by honour of thy house prickd on by public wrongs sustaind in france either to get the town again or die and i as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror as sure as in this latebetrayed town great coeurdelions heart was buried so sure i swear to get the town or die
and therefore apt because quick
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy but come here as before never so help you mercy how strange or odd soeer i bear myself as i perchance hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on that you at such times seeing me never shall with arms encumberd thus or this headshake or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase as well well we know or we could an if we would or if we list to speak or there be an if they might or such ambiguous giving out to note that you know aught of me this not to do so grace and mercy at your most need help you swear
and therefore do we what we are commanded stop close their mouths let them not speak a word is he sure bound look that you bind them fast reenter titus with lavinia he bearing a knife and she a basin
and therefore is he idle
and therefore lovely tamora queen of goths that like the stately phoebe mongst her nymphs dost overshine the gallantst dames of rome if thou be pleased with this my sudden choice behold i choose thee tamora for my bride and will create thee empress of rome speak queen of goths dost thou applaud my choice and here i swear by all the roman gods sith priest and holy water are so near and tapers burn so bright and every thing in readiness for hymenaeus stand i will not resalute the streets of rome or climb my palace till from forth this place i lead espoused my bride along with me
and therefore tis called a sensible tale and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening now i begin imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress
and therefore will come the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love marry i cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet nor i cannot woo in festival terms sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee
and therein hellish dog thou hast undone woe to her chance and damnd her loathed choice accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend
and thereof came it that the man was mad the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dogs tooth it seems his sleeps were hinderd by thy railing and therefore comes it that his head is light thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and whats a fever but a fit of madness thou sayst his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barrd what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and lifepreserving rest to be disturbd would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits
and thereof comes the proverb blessing of your heart you brew good ale
and theres for twitting me with perjury
and therewithal the best or let her beauty look through a casement to allure false hearts and be false with them
and these are not fairies i was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that they were fairies see now how wit may be made a jackalent when tis upon ill employment
and they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the courtiers hands are perfumed with civet
and they have been grandjurymen since before noah was a sailor
and this
and this for me struck home to show my strength
and this is mine sweet henry favour him
and this is more masters than you can deny prince john is this morning secretly stolen away hero was in this manner accused in this very manner refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died master constable let these men be bound and brought to leonatos i will go before and show him their examination
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly
and this my neighbour too
and this was it i gave him being abed
and this way have you well expounded it
and this withal
and thither will i bring thee valentine
and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us any thing
and those boils did run say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core
and those occasions uncle were of force therefore my loving lords our pleasure is that richard be restored to his blood
and those that youll procure from king leontes
and thou a natural coward without instinct
and thou art honest too i wish i could be made so many men and all of you clappd up together in an antony that i might do you service so good as you have done
and thou hadst been set i the stocks for that question thou hadst well deserved it
and thou shalt die fort
and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt
and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly with his face backward in humane gentleness welcome to troy now by anchises life welcome indeed by venus hand i swear no man alive can love in such a sort the thing he means to kill more excellently
and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thourt a threepiled piece i warrant thee i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a french velvet do i speak feelingly now
and thou unfit for any place but hell
and thought they margaret was hero
and three times as much more and yet nothing at all don
and three times thrice is nine
and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu
and thus it may be come sir will you aboard i have a health for you
and thus she means videlicet
and thy advice this night ill put in practise therefore sweet proteus my directiongiver let us into the city presently to sort some gentlemen well skilld in music i have a sonnet that will serve the turn to give the onset to thy good advice
and thy ambition gloucester
and till he tell the truth let the supposed fairies pinch him sound and burn him with their tapers
and till the tears that she hath shed for thee like envious floods oerrun her lovely face she was the fairest creature in the world and yet she is inferior to none
and time is at his period
and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor
and tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love
and to be a soldier
and to kill the marvel shall be so ever
and to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence
and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude
and to procure safeconduct from agamemnon
and to sink in it should you burden love too great oppression for a tender thing
and to speak truth thou deservest no less this monument of the victory will i bear and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse heels till i do come to london where we will have the mayors sword borne before us

and when i lived i was your other wife and when you loved you were my other husband
and when it breaks i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet childs death
and when its writ for my sake read it over and if it please you so if not why so
and when please you to say so
and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence
and when the king comes offer no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
and when was he wont to wash his face
and wherefore not ships no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
and while i live ill neer fly from a man
and whither go they
and who is your deer
and whosoeer gainsays king edwards right by this i challenge him to single fight
and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of natures salework ods my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too no faith proud mistress hope not after it tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman tis such fools as you that makes the world full of illfavourd children tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her but mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer so take her to thee shepherd fare you well
and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue good prudence smatter with your gossips go
and why not as the lion
and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banishd from myself and silvia is myself banishd from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if silvia be not seen what joy is joy if silvia be not by unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by silvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on silvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence fosterd illumined cherishd kept alive i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life
and why not queen
and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper
and why not you
and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am armd and dangers are to me indifferent
and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street
and why so
and why so my lord
and will deny him ill have five hundred voices of that sound
and will they so the gallants shall be taskd for ladies we shall every one be maskd and not a man of them shall have the grace despite of suit to see a ladys face hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear and then the king will court thee for his dear hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine so shall biron take me for rosaline and change your favours too so shall your loves woo contrary deceived by these removes
and will you
and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
and will you credit this base drudges words that speaks he knows not what
and wilt thou have me
and wilt thou learn of me
and win them too therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents
and wished to see thee crossgartered
and with what wing the staniel cheques at it
and work in their shirt too as myself for example that am a butcher
and would you not do much to do them good
and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turnd to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee that art a votary to fond desire once more adieu my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shippd
and yet a dispensation may be had
and yet but justice for though this king were great his greatness was no guard to bar heavens shaft but sin had his reward
and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee use no entreaty for it is in vain
and yet how nature erring from itself
and yet i come not well
and yet i fear you for you are fatal then when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear
and yet i think jet did he never see
and yet i was last chidden for being too slow
and yet i would i had oerlooked the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her what a fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy enforced my heart to smile my penance is to call lucetta back and ask remission for my folly past what ho lucetta
and yet i would that you would answer me
and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood
and yet my sky shall not want
and yet you halt not
and yonder caesar
and york as fast upon your grace exclaims swearing that you withhold his levied host collected for this expedition

angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touchd but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission

antony is come into the field
antony leave thy lascivious wassails when thou once wast beaten from modena where thou slewst hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou foughtst against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsedst on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lankd not
antony only that would make his will lord of his reason what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other why should he follow the itch of his affection should not then have nickd his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the meered question twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing

had i but died an hour before this chance i had lived a blessed time for from this instant there s nothing serious in mortality all is but toys renown and grace is dead the wine of life is drawn and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of
had i plantation of this isle my lord
had i this cheek to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch whose every touch would force the feelers soul to the oath of loyalty this object which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye fixing it only here should i damnd then slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol join gripes with hands made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as with labour then bypeeping in an eye base and unlustrous as the smoky light thats fed with stinking tallow it were fit that all the plagues of hell should at one time encounter such revolt
had i three ears ild hear thee
had it pleased heaven to try me with affliction had they raind all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head steepd me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but alas to make me a fixed figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garnerd up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there patience thou young and roselippd cherubin ay there look grim as hell

had you a special warrant for the deed
had you not been their father these white flakes had challenged pity of them was this a face to be opposed against the warring winds to stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder in the most terrible and nimble stroke of quick cross lightning to watchpoor perdu with this thin helm mine enemys dog though he had bit me should have stood that night against my fire and wast thou fain poor father to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw alack alack tis wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded all he wakes speak to him

hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposed or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousins death
hadst thou done so the kings that have revolted and the soldier that has this morning left thee would have still followd thy heels
hadst thou groand for him as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect that i have been disloyal to thy bed and that he is a bastard not thy son sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind he is as like thee as a man may be not like to me or any of my kin and yet i love him
hadst thou in person neer offended me even for his sake am i pitiless remember boys i pourd forth tears in vain to save your brother from the sacrifice but fierce andronicus would not relent therefore away with her and use her as you will the worse to her the better loved of me

he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband
he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i cannot get i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop who falling there to find his fellow forth unseen inquisitive confounds himself so i to find a mother and a brother in quest of them unhappy lose myself here comes the almanac of my true date what now how chance thou art returnd so soon
he that dies pays all debts i defy thee mercy upon us
he that flies so will neer return again
he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villany and so repose sweet gold for their unrest that have their alms out of the empress chest
he that has a house to puts head in has a good headpiece the codpiece that will house before the head has any the head and he shall louse so beggars marry many the man that makes his toe what he his heart should make shall of a corn cry woe and turn his sleep to wake for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass
he that has the two fair daughters ist he you mean
he that hath lost her too so is the queen that most desired the match but not a courtier although they wear their faces to the bent of the kings looks hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at
he that hath missd the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her i mean that married her alack good man and therefore banishdis a creature such as to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like there would be something failing in him that should compare i do not think so fair an outward and such stuff within endows a man but he

he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another whats their seeking
he that will think to live till he be old give me some help o cruel o you gods
he that with the plume tis a most gallant fellow i would he loved his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier ist not a handsome gentleman

he thinks being twenty times of better fortune he is twenty men to one
he thinks he still is at his instrument lucius awake
he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seent or been an instrument to vice you tot that you have touchd his queen forbiddenly
he took good rest tonight tis hoped his sickness is discharged
he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me
he uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit
he wants advice
he was a king blessd of the king of kings unto the french the dreadful judgementday so dreadful will not be as was his sight the battles of the lord of hosts he fought the churchs prayers made him so prosperous
he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
he was a prince
he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins
he was conveyd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishops huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercise
he was disposed to mirth but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him enobarbus
he was drunk then my lord it can be no better
he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge could be set up against mortality
he was expected then but not approachd
he was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so gerard de narbon
he was gotten in drink is not the humour conceited
he was i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered
he was in the right and so indeed it is ten the clock there give me a calendar who saw the sun today
he was the first that ever bore arms
he was too hard for him directly to say the troth ont before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado
he was why so go all which way it will the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold and will i fear revolt on herefords side sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester bid her send me presently a thousand pound hold take my ring
he waxes desperate with imagination
he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
he well may be a stranger for he comes to an honourd triumph strangely furnished
he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness
he went hence even now
he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling
he will an if he live to be a man
he will be talking
he will be the physician that should be the patient
he will clapperclaw thee tightly bully
he will come straight look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with and that your grace hath screend and stood between much heat and him ill sconce me even here pray you be round with him
he will deserve more
he will do all in all as hastings doth
he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wifes brother then his cheek lookd pale and on my face he turnd an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer
he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
he will maintain you like a gentlewoman
he will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure
he will not be commanded heres another more potent than the first thunder second apparition a bloody child
he will not fight with me domitius
he will not say so
he will seek there on my word neither press coffer chest trunk well vault but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places and goes to them by his note there is no hiding you in the house
he will shake your rome about your ears
he will stay till ye come
he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but little more to say sir of his honesty he has every thing that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing
he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinewed to our defence
he wishd today our enterprise might thrive i fear our purpose is discovered
he woman i say thy husband dost understand the word my friend thy husband honest honest iago
he wonderd that your lordship would suffer him to spend his youth at home while other men of slender reputation put forth their sons to seek preferment out some to the wars to try their fortune there some to discover islands far away some to the studious universities for any or for all these exercises he said that proteus your son was meet and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home which would be great impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth
he wooes both high and low both rich and poor both young and old one with another ford he loves the gallimaufry ford perpend
he words me girls he words me that i should not be noble to myself but hark thee charmian
he would not
he would not seem to know me
he would not stay at your petitions made his business more material
he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit
he wrings at some distress
he wrought better that made the painter and yet hes but a filthy piece of work
head and butt an hastywitted body would say your head and butt were head and horn

his grace looks cheerfully and smooth today theres some conceit or other likes him well when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit i think theres never a man in christendom that can less hide his love or hate than he for by his face straight shall you know his heart
his health is well sir
his highness comes post from marseilles of as able body as when he numbered thirty he will be here tomorrow or i am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed
his highness yet doth speak and holds belief that being brought into the open air it would allay the burning quality of that fell poison which assaileth him
his horses go about
his hour is almost past
his incivility confirms no less good doctor pinch you are a conjurer establish him in his true sense again and i will please you what you will demand
his is certain ours is doubtful
his is the right and therefore pardon me
his leg is too big for hectors
his legs bestrid the ocean his reard arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder for his bounty there was no winter int an autumn twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphinlike they showd his back above the element they lived in in his livery walkd crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates droppd from his pocket
his letters bear his mind not i my lord
his little speaking shows his love but small
his love
his love and wisdom approved so to your majesty may plead for amplest credence
his majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and theres an end
his majesty tendering my persons safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower
his master and he saving your worships reverence are scarce catercousins
his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
his name as if i knew not his name i have brought him up ever since he was three years old and his name is tranio
his name i pray you
his name is barnardine
his name is romeo and a montague the only son of your great enemy
his name my lord is tyrrel
his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left
his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove fors power to thunder his hearts his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death heres goodly work
his neck will come to your waist a cord sir
his noble kinsman most degenerate king but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing yet see no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish
his nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born
his only child he had two sons if this be worth your hearing mark it the eldest of them at three years old i the swathingclothes the other from their nursery were stoln and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went
his own impatience takes from aufidius a great part of blame lets make the best of it
his princess say you with him
his purpose meets you twas to bring this greek to calchas house and there to render him for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid lets have your company or if you please haste there before us i constantly do think or rather call my thought a certain knowledge my brother troilus lodges there tonight rouse him and give him note of our approach with the whole quality wherefore i fear we shall be much unwelcome
his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent
his qualities being at this poor price i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
his ransom there is none but i shall pay ill hale the dauphin headlong from his throne his crown shall be the ransom of my friend four of their lords ill change for one of ours farewell my masters to my task will i bonfires in france forthwith i am to make to keep our great saint georges feast withal ten thousand soldiers with me i will take whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake
his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking i have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness
his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next
his taints and honours waged equal with him
his very genius hath taken the infection of the device man
his very hair is of the dissembling colour
his vices you would say theres no virtue whipped out of the court they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide
his wife ant like your worship
his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath raised the wall and houses too
his words were farewell mistress nothing else
his worth is warrant for his welcome hither if this be he you oft have wishd to hear from

i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it wasas i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus oersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you

i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well
i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat
i know not where to turn o welcome home and welcome general and yere welcome all
i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i chequed my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd but god be thankd theres no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him

i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner
i know that but i would have thee hence and here again i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be thats certain wise or ill none virtuous or ill never cheapen her fair or ill never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour
i know that fool

i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roard and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone
i know that voice

i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure
i know where it is situate
i know you all and will awhile uphold the unyoked humour of your idleness yet herein will i imitate the sun who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world that when he please again to be himself being wanted he may be more wonderd at by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him if all the year were playing holidays to sport would be as tedious as to work but when they seldom come they wishd for come and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents so when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised by how much better than my word i am by so much shall i falsify mens hopes and like bright metal on a sullen ground my reformation glittering oer my fault shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off ill so offend to make offence a skill redeeming time when men think least i will

i think alexander the great was born in macedon his father was called philip of macedon as i take it
i think at the north gate for there stand lords
i think by some odd gimmors or device their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on else neer could they hold out so as they do by my consent well even let them alone

i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on
i think he only loves the world for him i pray thee let us go and find him out and quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other
i think he thinks upon the savage bull tush fear not man well tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee as once europa did at lusty jove when he would play the noble beast in love
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple

i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars
i think it be sir i deny it not antipholus
i think it be thine indeed for thou liest int
i think it be two oclock
i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here
i think it is good morrow is it not
i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn i tell you captain if you look in the maps of the orld i warrant you sall find in the comparisons between macedon and monmouth that the situations look you is both alike there is a river in macedon and there is also moreover a river at monmouth it is called wye at monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river but tis all one tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers and there is salmons in both if you mark alexanders life well harry of monmouths life is come after it indifferent well for there is figures in all things alexander god knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and his angers look you kill his best friend cleitus
i think it lacks of twelve

i think no usurer but has a fool to his servant my mistress is one and i am her fool when men come to borrow of your masters they approach sadly and go away merry but they enter my mistress house merrily and go away sadly the reason of this varros servanti could render one
i think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion
i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time
i think not so
i think not so my lord
i think nothing my lord
i think or in any religion
i think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow
i think she has certain it is i liked her and boarded her i the wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancys course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdued me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at marketprice have bought
i think she means that there was more than one confederate in the fact ay more there was or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
i think shell sooner prove a soldier iron may hold with her but never lutes
i think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
i think so
i think so charmian dull of tongue and dwarfish what majesty is in her gait remember if eer thou lookdst on majesty
i think so killd she i killd i did so but thou strikest me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom
i think so too
i think so too but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
i think that one of them is hereabout and cannot make away
i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
i think the devil will not have me damned lest the oil thats in me should set hell on fire he would never else cross me thus enter sir hugh evans disguised as before pistol as hobgoblin mistress quickly anne page and others as fairies with tapers
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties
i think thee now some common customer
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation
i think there are sir i heard them talked of
i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note
i think theres no man speaks better welsh ill to dinner
i think this be the most villanous house in all london road for fleas i am stung like a tench
i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
i think this talbot be a fiend of hell
i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands
i think this upstart is old talbots ghost he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit for gods sake let him have em to keep them here they would but stink and putrefy the air
i think thou art an ass
i think thou art in mind and so am i
i think thou dost and for i know thourt full of love and honesty and weighst thy words before thou givest them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man thats just they are close delations working from the heart that passion cannot rule
i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee
i think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter but tell me jack whose fellows are these that come after
i think twas soto that your honour means

i think you know him master doctor caius the renowned french physician
i think youll turn a child again
i think your highness saw this many a day
i think your lordship is not ignorant how his companion youthful valentine attends the emperor in his royal court
i thought all for the best
i thought as much he would be above the clouds
i thought as much one sorrow never comes but brings an heir that may succeed as his inheritor and so in ours some neighbouring nation taking advantage of our misery hath stuffd these hollow vessels with their power to beat us down the which are down already and make a conquest of unhappy me whereas no glorys got to overcome
i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will
i thought by your readiness in the office you had continued in it some time you say seven years together
i thought no less it is his policy to haste thus fast to find us unprovided
i thought of her even in these looks i made but your petition is yet unanswerd i will to your father your honour not oerthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord
i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
i thought the king had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall
i thought thou hadst been resolute
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion
i thought you had been willing to resign
i told her so my lord on your displeasures peril and on mine she should not visit you
i told him gently of our grievances of his oathbreaking which he mended thus by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us
i told him that your father was at venice and that you lookd for him this day in padua
i told him what i thought and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true
i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before
i told you my lord
i told you sir they were redhot with drinking so fun of valour that they smote the air for breathing in their faces beat the ground for kissing of their feet yet always bending towards their project then i beat my tabour at which like unbackd colts they prickd their ears advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses as they smelt music so i charmd their ears that calflike they my lowing followd through toothd briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns which entered their frail shins at last i left them i the filthymantled pool beyond your cell there dancing up to the chins that the foul lake oerstunk their feet
i told your grace they would talk anon
i told your majesty as much before this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty
i took an oath that he should quietly reign
i took him sleeping that is finishd too and the athenian woman by his side that when he waked of force she must be eyed
i took him to be killed with a thunderstroke but art thou not drowned stephano i hope now thou art not drowned is the storm overblown i hid me under the dead mooncalfs gaberdine for fear of the storm and art thou living stephano o stephano two neapolitans scaped
i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come
i trouble you
i true how now what wicked deem is this
i trust the ghost of talbot is not there now he is gone my lord you need not fear
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em

i understand not what you mean by this
i understand the business i hear it to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do any thing extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not dot i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lanes end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work
i understand thee not
i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog
i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine wheneer we come to our account
i understand thy looks that pretty welsh which thou pourst down from these swelling heavens i am too perfect in and but for shame in such a parley should i answer thee i understand thy kisses and thou mine and thats a feeling disputation but i will never be a truant love till i have learned thy language for thy tongue makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd sung by a fair queen in a summers bower with ravishing division to her lute
i understand you not
i understand you not my griefs are double
i understand you not my lord

i was about to tell thee when my heart as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain lest hector or my father should perceive me i have as when the sun doth light a storm buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile but sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness

i wonder at it
i wonder doctor thou askst me such a question have i not been thy pupil long hast thou not learnd me how to make perfumes distil preserve yea so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections having thus far proceeded unless thou thinkst me devilishist not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects
i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from cliffords and northumberlands pursuit had he been taen we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad

i would all the world might be cozened for i have been cozened and beaten too if it should come to the ear of the court how i have been transformed and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop and liquor fishermens boots with me i warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till i were as crestfallen as a dried pear i never prospered since i forswore myself at primero well if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers i would repent now whence come you

i would correct him
i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service
i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me
i would do more than that if more were needful look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blisterd her report she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this
i would exult man you know he brought me out o favour with my lady about a bearbaiting here
i would fain know what you have to say
i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told mewhat might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or tablebook or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulseda short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for
i would forget her but a fever she reigns in my blood and will rememberd be
i would friar peter
i would have all well betwixt you
i would have broke mine eyestrings crackd them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followd him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turnd mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him
i would have had thee there and here again ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there o constancy be strong upon my side set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue i have a mans mind but a womans might how hard it is for women to keep counsel art thou here yet

i would i had any drum of the enemys i would swear i recovered it
i would i had been there
i would i had not known him it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating if she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother i could not have owed her a more rooted love
i would i had so i had broke thy pate and askd thee mercy fort
i would i had that corporal soundness now as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest he lasted long but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act it much repairs me to talk of your good father in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe today in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awaked them and his honour clock to itself knew the true minute when exception bid him speak and at this time his tongue obeyd his hand who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bowd his eminent top to their low ranks making them proud of his humility in their poor praise he humbled such a man might be a copy to these younger times which followd well would demonstrate them now but goers backward
i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt
i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you ill not trust your word
i would i knew his mind

i would it were hellpains for thy sake and my poor doing eternal for doing i am past as i will by thee in what motion age will give me leave
i would it were no worse
i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon
i would it were that you might kill your stomach on your meat and not upon your maid

i would not be cured youth
i would not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frailst and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be calld tyrants butchers murderers now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean but upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is no force in eyes that can do hurt
i would not by my will have troubled you but since you make your pleasure of your pains i will no further chide you
i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death

i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband but it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good antonio the honest antonio o that i had a title good enough to keep his name company
i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest me out of tune

it is the quality o the climate
it is the stars the stars above us govern our conditions else one self mate and mate could not beget such different issues you spoke not with her since
it is the very error of the moon she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad
it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection i pray thee sing and let me woo no more
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord
it is the worst and all my lord he writes
it is to be all made of faith and service and so am i for phebe
it is to be all made of fantasy all made of passion and all made of wishes all adoration duty and observance all humbleness all patience and impatience all purity all trial all observance and so am i for phebe
it is to be all made of sighs and tears and so am i for phebe
it is to be recovered but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer i would have that drum or another or hic jacet
it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
it is too heavy for so light a tune
it is too heavy for your grace to wear

it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestlers heels and your heart both in an instant
it is your former promise
it is your graces pleasure to commend not my desert

it may be right but you are i the wrong to speak before your time proceed
it may be so but i did never see it come gaoler bring me where the goldsmith is i long to know the truth hereof at large
it may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but so

it may be so if he have robbd these men he shall be answerable and so farewell
it may be so my lord hear nature hear dear goddess hear suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful into her womb convey sterility dry up in her the organs of increase and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honour her if she must teem create her child of spleen that it may live and be a thwart disnatured torment to her let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks turn all her mothers pains and benefits to laughter and contempt that she may feel how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child away away
it may be very likely
it may be you have mistaken him my lord
it may not be
it may not be good madam pardon me
it may well be called joves tree when it drops forth such fruit
it may well be there is a mutiny ins mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found there on my conscience put unwittingly forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject
it might be yours or hers for aught i know
it might but it is not now
it might have been recovered
it might my lord
it must and shall be so content thyself
it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands
it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown himthat and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climberupward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell
it must be done this afternoon hark slave it is but this the princess comes to hunt here in the park and in her train there is a gentle lady when tongues speak sweetly then they name her name and rosaline they call her ask for her and to her white hand see thou do commend this sealdup counsel theres thy guerdon go
it must be himself then
it must be se offendendo it cannot be else for here lies the point if i drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is to act to do to perform argal she drowned herself wittingly
it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there
it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected
it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the kings honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill
it must be your imagination then and not theirs
it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance
it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be
it must of force
it pleased them to think me worthy of pompion the great for mine own part i know not the degree of the worthy but i am to stand for him

she and the dauphin have been juggling i did imagine what would be her refuge
she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her this being done let the law go whistle i warrant you
she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap and she will sing the song that pleaseth you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep charming your blood with pleasing heaviness making such difference twixt wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the heavenlyharnessd team begins his golden progress in the east

she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most
she did indeed
she did my lord when valentine was here
she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver you should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness this was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion where you will hang like an icicle on a dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy

she hath been then more feard than harmd my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries
she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
she hath good leave
she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash and so lets leave her to her silent walks

she is alive behold her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels which pericles hath lost begin to part their fringes of bright gold the diamonds of a most praised water do appear to make the world twice rich live and make us weep to hear your fate fair creature rare as you seem to be
she is asleep good wench lets sit down quiet for fear we wake her softly gentle patience the vision enter solemnly tripping one after another six personages clad in white robes wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in their hands they first congee unto her then dance and at certain changes the first two hold a spare garland over her head at which the other four make reverent curtsies then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two who observe the same order in their changes and holding the garland over her head which done they deliver the same garland to the last two who likewise observe the same order at which as it were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them the music continues

so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eightyearold horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in
so did he never the sparrow

so far afoot i shall be weary love
so far be mine my most redoubted lord as my true service shall deserve your love
so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honours thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is aripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye i feel my heart new opend o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again why how now cromwell
so fitly go bid all my friends again lucius lucullus and sempronius all sirrah all ill once more feast the rascals
so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butchers knife what scene of death hath roscius now to act
so foul and fair a day i have not seen
so fulvia told me i prithee turn aside and weep for her then bid adieu to me and say the tears belong to egypt good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look life perfect honour
so glad of this as they i cannot be who are surprised withal but my rejoicing at nothing can be more ill to my book for yet ere suppertime must i perform much business appertaining
so god help montague as he proves true

so hath my lord dared him to single fight
so hath the business that i come to speak of lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury a mighty and a fearful head they are if promises be kept on every hand as ever offerd foul play in the state
so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty
so he did my lord the army marvelld at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we lookd for no less spoil than glory
so he does indeed
so he doth you my lord and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound
so he had need for tis threadbare well i say it was never merry world in england since gentlemen came up
so he has
so he is
so he is my lord thats gone made himself much sport out of him by his authority he remains here which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness and indeed he has no pace but runs where he will
so he says here
so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatterd smile and that ill live upon
so i am free yet would not so have been durst i have done my will o cassius far from this country pindarus shall run where never roman shall take note of him
so i am satisfied give me a bowl of wine i have not that alacrity of spirit nor cheer of mind that i was wont to have set it down is ink and paper ready
so i am to let him live
so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee
so i do
so i do against my will
so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right
so i do madonna but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
so i do sir
so i do still by these pickers and stealers
so i do whats the matter
so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell
so i hear
so i heard you say don
so i hope i was not born to die on brutus sword
so i lose none in seeking to augment it but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear i shall be counselld
so i may answer thee with one as old that was a woman when queen guinover of britain was a little wench as touching the hit it
so i say
so i shall mend mine own by the lack of thine
so i told him my lord and i said i heard your grace say so and my lord he speaks most vilely of you like a foulmouthed man as he is and said he would cudgel you
so i will my liege as i live
so i will sir
so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek
so i would you did then twere past all doubt yould call your children yours
so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servants damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance so that here men are punished for beforebreach of the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare
so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot
so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is the greatest admiration of the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great you shall find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble pabble in pompeys camp i warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
so indeed i did
so infinitely endeard
so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my nearst of life and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite
so is it if thou knewst our purposes

we do it not alone sir
we do my lord
we do not know
we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my greatgrandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnishd kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fulness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girding with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood

we follow thee juliet the county stays
we four set upon some dozen
we from the west will send destruction into this citys bosom
we go wrong we go wrong

we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass
we have been guided by thee hitherto and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust
we have been praying for our husbands healths which speed we hope the better for our words are they returnd

we have not yet set down this day of triumph tomorrow in mine opinion is too sudden for i myself am not so well provided as else i would be were the day prolongd
we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members
we have received your letters full of love your favours the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment
we have scotchd the snake not killd it shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy duncan is in his grave after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further
we have sir
we have some haste leonato
we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an oergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their childrens sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum
we have sworn my lord already
we have whereupon the earl of worcester hath broke his staff resignd his stewardship and all the household servants fled with him to bolingbroke
we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now
we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer byt behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly
we hear our bloody cousins are bestowd in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly hie you to horse adieu till you return at night goes fleance with you

we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before well chide this dauphin at his fathers door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought
we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good so find we profit by losing of our prayers
we john cade so termed of our supposed father
we judge no less uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that raild against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him
we know each other well
we know him for no less though we are but strangers to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and which i hear from common rumours now lord timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him

we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood henry is dead and never shall revive upon a wooden coffin we attend and deaths dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify like captives bound to a triumphant car what shall we curse the planets of mishap that plotted thus our glorys overthrow or shall we think the subtlewitted french conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him by magic verses have contrived his end bishop
